Bartender Application Assignment- Senior Project 8/31/2017
This application allows the bartender to register/log in and takes them to their administrator home page.
On the home page they have the option to view the menu or view the order queue.
On the menu, the drinks and drink costs are displayed with options to edit, see details, add a new drink to the menu, or add the drink as an order.
It then takes the bartender to the order queue if he/she clicks the "add to order" option/link.
The bartender can then log out. 

I made 3 databases: one for the menu items, one for the order queue, and one for the registration/login information of the bartender/user.
They are stored locally.
